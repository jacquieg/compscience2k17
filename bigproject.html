             Great makeup begins with great skincare. Prep your skin with moisturizer and primer.  <br>
             This will ensure a flawless base that keeps makeup in place all day. Not only that, but it<br>
             will also keep your skin healthy after any and all make up products that you use.        <br>

            Among the most important features on your face the eyebrows are number one. Whether one<br>
            wants to admit it or not, the eyebrows make a big difference in ones appearance, which is<br>
            why eyebrow pomade and a spoolie brush are must haves. Something to take in consideration,<br>
            which I personally consider one of the best pomade and spoolie brush sets, is the dual-sided<br>
            Anastasia Beverly Hills tool to brush and pomade. The dual-sided tool helps sculpt perfect<br>
            arches and the dipbrow Pomade easy to apply and smudge proof.<br>

            There is really no need to fiddle around with applying false lashes. Although the option will always<br>
            be there for anyone who has a personal interest in them, there's is ways to avoid the<br>
            application of these falsies. Tag-team Kat Von D Tattoo Liner gives the illusion of a thicker fringe<br>
            and with a few swipes of Benefit’s They Are Real Lengthening Volumizing Mascara you will<br>
            have dramatic length in seconds<br>

           No kit is complete without go-to lip colors. Two of the most commonly used lip colors are nude and red.<br>
           This is bcause these two hues are universally flattering and versatile, which is just enough to keep you<br>
           covered from the office to the dance floor, but of course never be scared to try a new color out. You'll<br>
           never know what you can get, even out of those colors that you completely doubt will suit your appearance.<br>

           In order to put apply your makeup properly you will need to use the right tools. One of many things I would
           personally suggest using is the Beautyblender. It is perfect for effortlessly blending foundations, blush,
           and concealer. For precise eyemakeup and dusting on powders reach for Sonia Kashuk's set, reminder these are
           just suggestions of what I personally believe to be the best products to use, but of course there's many more
           sets out there in the market. Just make sure to get the one that best suits you and you feel you can work better
           with. This of course doesn't always mean you have to reach for the higher end products. You'll be surprised how
           good products can work, even when they're from drug stores.

           Now, of course we do not want to look completely pale and abnoraml, so to fix that up add healthy color and
           a subtle glow to your skin with a classic blush and highlighter. Nars and Becca have both created cult favorites
           that are must-haves for every kit, but like I mentioned before, it's all about finding colors that suit your personal
           interest, and yes that doesn't always mean they have to be higher end products like the ones I've just listed.

          To complete the entire look, all you need is some eyeshadow. For beginners this might be scary to try, I can definitely
          agree with that, but you're never going to learn and get better if you never try. Plus, now in days, there is plenty of make
          up tutorials in which you can learn which colors go best with which, which tools to use for the best results, and how to blend
          the products right. I eouldn't recommend getting single eyeshadows, since the majority of the time you're using a variety in one
          look. My recommendations of a few palettes that can do you great are the Anastasia

          Even the most skilled makeup artists make mistakes, but don't stress it. Dabbing a Q-tip into lotion is their secret for instantly
          erasing errors. For those nights when you’re too lazy to wash your face, and yes we all have those moments don't be embarrased,
          makeup wipes will be your best friend. It's always better to sleep with a clean face then to have a caked on face all night. The
          more you avoid pimples on your face the happier and better you will feel!
