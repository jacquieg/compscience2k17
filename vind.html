            What is Vindinium?<br>
            Vindinium is a video game that programmed using AI. Users must program their bots to do 3 things which are:<br>
            <ul>.get mines<br>
            .go to tavers<br>
            .attack enemies<br>

            How My Bot Goes To Taverns At 50hp:<br>
            <br>
            When it comes specifically to this, I programmed<br>
            my bot to go to the closest tavern for health<br>
            when it is under 50hp. This is so that in<br>
            situations like when it's in danger, it can stay<br>
            alive. What the code does here is it looks at the positions<br>
            of all the taverns. It the determines which is the<br>
            nearest to my Bot wherever, depending on where it is on the map<br>
            It then console.logs that it is heading towards the closest Tavern.<br>
            The matter of when it takes this action is in the if else statement<br>

            It determines which is closer, then determines the action of going to <br>
            that mine to make it their own. My reasoning behind setting up the code this way<br>
            was so that when the game begins, I will start getting gold very instantly and rapidly<br>
            which helps me, the player, have better chances of winning the game.<br>

            What I Learned About AI:<br>
            This was not my first year having an experience working with AI or vindinium, which ever you want to<br>
            concider it, but last year I didn't get much of a feel or understanding behind the purposes or what<br>
            this was. My very first time hearing about it, it truthfully didn't interest me as much as it<br>
            should have, but this year I really tried to understand it and have as much of a good time coding<br>
            as I was playing it. Thanks to the help of a peer, Understandind the code helped me much more.<br>
            What I learned by playing and coding this was that to be a successful player you have to know<br>
            tacticts and solutions to every aspect, such as: claiming freemines, attacking enemy bots, or simply<br>
            just looking for taverns. Of course playing the game, there is always a simple way of getting it done,<br>
            but the best part of the game is being able to challenge yourself to reach something higher than what is<br>
            expected. Other players are in the same position as you are, which only makes the game much more intense.<br>
            Using these skills in real life can help in many ways as well. Personally I believe so, but we are all<br>
            different as individuals. Back to the subject, Ai and computer science are full og knowledge and getting<br>
            an experience with these has helped me grow as a student.<br>
